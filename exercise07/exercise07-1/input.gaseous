Input format
- temperature
- number of particles
- particle density
- cutoff distance
- standard deviation of the proposed step*
- total number of steps
- number of equilibration steps


* i.e. at each step, a particle is displaced by an amount
drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and this value
of the standard deviation, then the new state is accepted
of rejected according to the algorithm.
